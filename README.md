## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a syncronous single threaded programming language.

"Everything in JavaScript happens inside an execution context"

Inside execution context there are two things 
1. Memory component
2. Code component

- In memory component variable and functions values can be stored in a  key value format.
- Code component is a place where whole JavaScript code is executed
- Memory component is also called as variable environment 
- And code component is also called as thread of execution.
